# Titanic-ML-Project
This project is based on the classic [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
The goal is to **predict which passengers survived** the Titanic shipwreck using **machine learning models**.

What I did:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Performed feature engineering
- Built and compared multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
  - XGBoost (with GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning)
  - Random Forest (with GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning)
- Created a simple ensemble by averaging model predictions
- Evaluated models using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 score

Technologies used:
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- scikit-learn

The project was compleated individually.
